# Project Kisan - AI-Powered Farmer Assistant

## Vision
Project Kisan is an AI-powered personal assistant that acts as a personal agronomist, market analyst, and government scheme navigator for small-scale farmers in India. Our mission is to revolutionize Indian farming by providing expert guidance, real-time market intelligence, and government scheme navigation through voice-first interactions in local languages.

## Problem Statement
Small-scale farmers in rural India face multiple challenges:
- Limited access to expert agricultural advice
- Lack of real-time market price information
- Difficulty navigating government schemes and subsidies
- Language barriers with existing digital solutions
- Inefficient land utilization and outdated farming practices

## Solution Overview
Project Kisan leverages Google AI technologies to create a comprehensive farming assistant that addresses all these challenges through a single, voice-first interface.
